### Day 0: January 20, 2017
1) **duplicate_encoder:**  It converts a string to a new string where each character in the new string is '(' if that character appears only once in the original string, or ')' if that character appears more than once in the original string. 

2) **digital_root:** A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, it takes the sum of the digits of n. If that value has two digits, it continues reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.

### Day 1: January 21, 2017

3) **pairity_outliner:**  You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. It contains a method that takes the array as an argument and returns N.

### Day 2: January 22, 2017

4) **exes_and_ohs:**  Checks to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method will return a boolean and is case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

### Day 3: January 23, 2017

5) **trailling_zero:** Finds to total number of trailling zeros in the factorial of a supplied number. 

### Day 4: January 24, 2017

6) **next_big_number:** A function that takes a positive integer number and returns the next bigger number formed by the same digits. If no bigger number can be composed using those digits, it return -1. Phew, it was tough.

### Day 5: January 25, 2017

7) **perfect_power:** Checks if the number is perfect power and returns the corresponding pair i^j. It returns nil if the number is not a perfect power.

8) **to_camel_case:**  It converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. For example : to_camel_case("the-stealth-warrior") retutns "theStealthWarrior"
