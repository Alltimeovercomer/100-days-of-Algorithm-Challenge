1) **duplicate_encoder:**  It converts a string to a new string where each character in the new string is '(' if that character appears only once in the original string, or ')' if that character appears more than once in the original string. 

2) **digital_root:** A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, it takes the sum of the digits of n. If that value has two digits, it continues reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.
