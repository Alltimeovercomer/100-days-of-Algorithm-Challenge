1) **duplicate_encoder:**  It converts a string to a new string where each character in the new string is '(' if that character appears only once in the original string, or ')' if that character appears more than once in the original string. 

2) **digital_root:** A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, it takes the sum of the digits of n. If that value has two digits, it continues reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.

3) **pairity_outliner:**  You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. It contains a method that takes the array as an argument and returns N.

4) **exes_and_ohs:**  Checks to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method will return a boolean and is case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

5) **trailling_zero:** Finds to total number of trailling zeros in the factorial of a supplied number.
